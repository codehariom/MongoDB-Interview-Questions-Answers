# Question :-  Find all individuals older than 25 but younger than 60, whose Location is "Skydiving".d

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.find({Age:{$lt:60, $gt:25}, Location:'Skateboarding'})`


## Explaintion :- 

Your query is almost correct, but there is a small issue with the syntax for specifying multiple conditions on the Age field. You should use the $and operator to combine the conditions. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.find({
  $and: [
    { Age: { $lt: 60 } },
    { Age: { $gt: 25 } }
  ],
  Location: 'Skateboarding'
})

This query will find documents in the emp_data collection where the Age field is greater than 25 and less than 60, and the Location field is 'Skateboarding'.
