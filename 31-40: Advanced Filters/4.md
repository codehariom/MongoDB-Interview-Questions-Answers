# Question :-  Query for records where the Apply Date is a weekend.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$project: {'Apply Date': 1,dayOfWeek: { $dayOfWeek: "$Apply Date" }  }},{ $match: {dayOfWeek: { $in: [1, 7] }}}])`

## Explaintion :- 

Your aggregation pipeline is almost correct, but there is a small issue with the field name Apply Date. In MongoDB, field names should not contain spaces. You should use the correct field name or use quotes around the field name if it contains spaces. Here is the corrected version of your pipeline:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      'Apply Date': 1,
      dayOfWeek: { $dayOfWeek: "$Apply Date" }
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      dayOfWeek: { $in: [1, 7] }
    }
  }
])

This pipeline will project the Apply Date field and calculate the day of the week for each document. It will then match documents where the dayOfWeek is either Sunday (1) or Saturday (7).
