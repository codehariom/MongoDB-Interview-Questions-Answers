# Question :-  Find all applicants with Company "Target" who applied between 2016 and 2019.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.find({ Job: "CEO","Apply Date": {  $gte: ISODate("2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"),  $lte: ISODate("2019-12-31T23:59:59.999Z") }})`

## Explaintion :- 

Your query to find documents with a specific job title and date range is almost correct, but there is a small issue with the ISODate function. Instead, you should use the new Date constructor for date queries. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.find(
   { 
     Job: "CEO",
     "Apply Date": { 
       $gte: new Date("2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"), 
       $lte: new Date("2019-12-31T23:59:59.999Z") 
     }
   }
)

This query will find documents in the emp_data collection where the Job field is "CEO" and the Apply Date field is within the specified date range.
