# Question :-  Retrieve records where Apply Date matches a specific year.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$match: {$expr: {$eq: [{ $year: "$Apply Date" }, 2020]}}}])`

## Explaintion :- 

To retrieve records where the Apply Date matches a specific year, you can use the $year operator in an aggregation pipeline. Here is an example query to find documents where the Apply Date is in the year 2020:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      $expr: {
        $eq: [{ $year: "$Apply Date" }, 2020]
      }
    }
  }
])

This query uses the $year operator to extract the year from the Apply Date field and matches it to the specified year (2020).
