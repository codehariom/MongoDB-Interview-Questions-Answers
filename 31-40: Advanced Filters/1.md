# Question :-  Retrieve all records where Name contains "a" and Location starts with "K".

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.find({Name:{$regex:/a/},Location:{$regex:/^K/}})`

## Explaintion :- 

To use regular expressions in MongoDB queries, you can use the $regex operator. Your query is almost correct, but you need to ensure that each field's regular expression is properly formatted. Here is the correct way to write your query:

db.emp_data.find({
  Name: { $regex: /a/ },
  Location: { $regex: /^K/ }
})

This query will find documents in the emp_data collection where the Name field contains the letter "a" and the Location field starts with the letter "K".
