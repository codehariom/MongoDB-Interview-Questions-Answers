# Question :-  Find all individuals with Name starting with "L".

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.collection.find({ Name: { $regex: /^L/, $options: "i" }})` 

## Explaintion :- 

The MongoDB query `db.collection.find({ Name: { $regex: /^L/, $options: "i" } })` retrieves all documents from the collection where the `Name` field starts with the letter `"L"`, case-insensitively. The `^L pattern `ensures that the match is at the beginning of the string, and the i option makes the match case-insensitive.
