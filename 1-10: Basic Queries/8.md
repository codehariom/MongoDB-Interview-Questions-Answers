The MongoDB query `db.emp_data.find({Age: {$gte: 20, $lte: 40}})` retrieves all documents from the emp_data collection where the Age field is greater than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 40. This means it will return all documents where the Age field falls within the range of 20 to 40, inclusive.
