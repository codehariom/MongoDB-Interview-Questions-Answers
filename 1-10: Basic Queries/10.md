# Question :-  Query for all Job titles containing "Engineer".

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.collection.find({Job: { $regex: "Engineer", $options: "i" }})` 

## Explaintion :- 

The MongoDB query` db.collection.find({ Job: { $regex: "Engineer", $options: "i" } })` retrieves all documents from the collection where the Job field contains the word `"Engineer"`, case-insensitively. The i option makes the match case-insensitive, ensuring that it matches "Engineer" regardless of the case (e.g., "engineer", "ENGINEER", etc.).
