# Question :- List all Jobs and the number of people in each job.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([$group: {_id,minAge{$min:Age},maxAge{$max:age}}])`

## Explaintion :- 

To use the $group stage in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to find the minimum and maximum age, you can structure your query as follows:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null, // Grouping by null to get the overall min and max age
      minAge: { $min: "$Age" },
      maxAge: { $max: "$Age" }
    }
  }
])

This query groups all documents together (using _id: null) and calculates the minimum and maximum age across the entire collection. Make sure to use the correct field names and syntax.
