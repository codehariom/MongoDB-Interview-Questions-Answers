# Question :- Count how many individuals have unique Names.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$group: { _id: "$Name" }},{$project: {  _id: 0, name: "$_id" }}]);`

## Explaintion :- 

Your aggregation pipeline to group documents by the Name field and then project a new field is almost correct. Here is the properly formatted query:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$Name"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      name: "$_id"
    }
  }
]);

This pipeline groups the documents in the emp_data collection by the Name field and then projects a new field name with the value of _id from the previous stage, effectively renaming _id to name in the output.
