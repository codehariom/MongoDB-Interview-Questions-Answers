# Question :- Group data by Location and calculate the average Age per location.


## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$group{_id:"$Location", avgAge:{$avg:'$Age'}}}])`


## Explaintion :- 

Your aggregation pipeline to calculate the average age grouped by location is almost correct. You just need to ensure that the field names are properly referenced. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$Location", // Group by the Location field
      avgAge: { $avg: "$Age" } // Calculate the average age
    }
  }
])

This query groups the documents in the emp_data collection by the Location field and calculates the average age for each location.
