# Question :-  Calculate the average Age of all individuals in the collection.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$group:{_id:null ,averageAge:{$avg:"$Age"}}}])`

## Explaintion :- 

The MongoDB query db.emp_data.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: null, averageAge: { $avg: "$Age" } } }]) calculates the average age of all documents in the emp_data collection.

Here's the query in a more readable format:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      averageAge: { $avg: "$Age" }
    }
  }
])

This operation groups all documents together (since _id is set to null) and calculates the average value of the Age field across all documents. The result will be a single document containing the averageAge field with the computed average age.
