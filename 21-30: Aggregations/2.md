# Question :- Group individuals by Company and count how many work in each.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$count:{$group:”$Company”}])`


## Explaintion :- 


It looks like there is a small syntax error in your query. To count the number of documents grouped by the Company field, you should use the $group stage followed by the $count accumulator. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$Company",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
])

This query groups the documents by the Company field and counts the number of documents in each group. The result will be a list of documents, each containing a Company and the corresponding count.
