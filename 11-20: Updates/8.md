# Question :-  Remove the Company field for individuals younger than 18.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.updateMany({age:{$gte:18}},{$unset:{Company:” ”}})`

## Explaintion :- 

The MongoDB query db.emp_data.updateMany({age: {$gte: 18}}, {$unset: {Company: " "}}) attempts to remove the Company field from all documents in the emp_data collection where the age field is greater than or equal to 18. However, the value for the field in the $unset operator should be an empty string, not a space.
