# Question :-  Update the Location of a person with id: 5 to "Mountain Hiking".
## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.updateOne({Location : "Basketball"}, {$set : {location:"Jogging"}})` 

## Explaintion :- 

The MongoDB query `db.emp_data.updateOne({Location: "Basketball"}, {$set: {location: "Jogging"}}) `updates a single document in the emp_data collection where the Location field is "Basketball". It sets the location field to "Jogging". If there are multiple documents that match the filter, only the first matching document will be updated.
