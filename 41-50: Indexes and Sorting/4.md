# Question :- Retrieve the top 5 oldest individuals, sorted by Age.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.agreegate([{$sort:{Age:-1},{$limit:5}])`

## Explaintion :- 

It looks like you have a small typo in your query. The correct method name is aggregate, not agreegate. Additionally, each stage in the aggregation pipeline should be enclosed in curly braces and separated by commas. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
   { $sort: { Age: -1 } },
   { $limit: 5 }
])

This query will sort the documents in the emp_data collection by the Age field in descending order and then limit the results to the top 5 documents.
