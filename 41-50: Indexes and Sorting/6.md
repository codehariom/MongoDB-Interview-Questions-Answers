# Question :-  Query and sort applicants by Location and then by Name.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.find().sort({Name:1},{Location:1})`


## Explaintion :- 

To sort documents by multiple fields in a MongoDB query, you should specify all the fields within a single object. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.find().sort({ Name: 1, Location: 1 })

This will sort the documents in the emp_data collection first by the Name field in ascending order and then by the Location field in ascending order.
