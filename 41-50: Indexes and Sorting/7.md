# Question :-  Retrieve the first 10 records sorted by Company.

## Answer:- 

 ### `db.emp_data.aggregate([{$sort:{Job:1}},{$limit:10}])`


## Explaintion :- 

Your query to sort and limit results in the emp_data collection using the aggregation pipeline is correct. Here is the query formatted properly:

db.emp_data.aggregate([
   { $sort: { Job: 1 } },
   { $limit: 10 }
])

This query will sort the documents in the emp_data collection by the Job field in ascending order and then limit the results to the top 10 documents.
