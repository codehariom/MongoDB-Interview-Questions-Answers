# Question :-  Create a compound index on Age and Location.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `db.emp_data.createIndexes([{Age:1},{Location:1}])`

## Explaintion :- 

Your query to create multiple indexes on the emp_data collection is almost correct. The field names should be enclosed in double quotes. Here is the corrected query:

db.emp_data.createIndexes([
   { "Age": 1 },
   { "Location": 1 }
])

This will create an ascending index on the Age field and another ascending index on the Location field in the emp_data collection.
