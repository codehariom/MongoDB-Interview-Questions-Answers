# Question :-  Retrieve records sorted by Age but excluding the field Company in results.

## Answer:- 

 ###  `var pipeline =[{"$sort":{"Age":1}}{"$unset":'Company'}]; db.emp_data.aggregate(pipeline)`

## Explaintion :- 

Your query to sort documents by the Age field in ascending order and then unset the Company field in the emp_data collection is correct. Here is the query formatted properly:

var pipeline = [
   { $sort: { Age: 1 } },
   { $unset: 'Company' }
];
db.emp_data.aggregate(pipeline);

This will sort the documents in the emp_data collection by the Age field in ascending order and remove the Company field from each document.
